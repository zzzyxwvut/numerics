A numeric converter (of Arabic and Roman numerals).

This project depends on `Ate` available from
[here](https://bitbucket.org/zzzyxwvut/ate.git "here").
Before building this project,  
make a local installation of `Ate`.

Should the search for the `java` executable fail to turn up the right one, take  
advantage of an
[`exec.executable`](https://www.mojohaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/exec-mojo.html#executable)
user property whose value can be an absolute  
file name.
